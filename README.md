Hey! My name is Reece Ballard! I am a Computer Science major at Occidental College and an intern at Delete the Divide. As the new Lead Backend Developer on DTD's web development team, I am actively involved in developing a new mentorship feature on DTD's current website using C#, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and SQL. I am also currently working on a personal project where I work extensively with Kotlin as I prepare to take a game design course in my upcoming college semester.

üîç **Technical Proficiencies:**

- **Languages:** Java, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Dart, SQL
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Figma, StarUML, VSCode, .NET Framework, Flutter

### Current Focus and Interests

I am looking to collaborate on mobile app projects. I am proficient in data structures and am considering becoming a tutor.

### Professional Experience

During my time working as an intern at DTD, I've been part of the mobile app team where I worked with Dart/Flutter and Figma to create a mobile barcode scanning app used by LA County. This app significantly increased productivity and cut the time it took to take inventory by 50%. 

Now, as Lead Backend Developer on the web development team, I work with databases and code in C# and SQL. My tasks include:

- Delegating work across the backend team
- Pair-programming to resolve bugs
- Conducting meetings with the ISD C# team for guidance on implementations and technologies
- Preparing presentations for upper management
- Participating in weekly/biweekly meetings with team leads to discuss progress, blockers, and resource needs

### Hobbies

My hobbies include playing basketball and editing videos. I also enjoy photography and run a photography business.
